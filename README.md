# Advanced-Topics-in-NLP

This project is based on the paper from Lake & Baroni (2018) and dataset provided by them, available at https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN. This project is a replication of their experiments 1,2 and 3 which also presents possible improvements. In the end, me and my colleagues managed to successfully replicate all the experiments, having lower accuracy scores for Experiment 2 and 3.
